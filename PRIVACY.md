# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2025-12-03**  
**Applies to: Vivere (iPadOS Application)**

---

## 1. Overview

Vivere is designed to support reminiscence therapy for older adults with early to mild dementia.  
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

Vivere is developed by **NetiZen** (“we”, “us”, “our”).

---

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1 Photos & Videos (User-Provided Content)

The app allows users to import photos and videos to support memory-based activities.

- Stored **locally on the device only**  
- **Never uploaded** or stored on cloud servers  
- Deleted only when the user removes them

---

### 2.2 Media Temporarily Sent for AI Processing

To provide enhanced therapeutic experiences, Vivere may send certain media **temporarily** to our backend server and third-party AI services for processing.

**Temporarily processed (not stored):**
- **Photos** (for generating animated “moving pictures”)  
- **Audio** recorded during sessions (for ASR)  
- **Text** prompts or responses  
- **Generated output** (e.g., video or text) returned to the device

All media is processed **only for the duration of the request** and is discarded immediately after processing.

---

### 2.3 Automatically Collected Technical Data

The app does **not** collect analytics, behavioral tracking, or personal identifiers.

Apple may collect anonymized crash and diagnostic data depending on the user’s device settings.  
We do not access, collect, or store this information.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use your data solely to:

- Provide reminiscence therapy features  
- Generate AI-powered video animations  
- Process speech input through ASR  
- Generate text responses from the AI Companion  

We **do not** use your data for:

- Advertising  
- Marketing  
- Analytics  
- Profiling  
- Selling or sharing with third parties

---

## 4. Data Storage & Retention

### Local Storage
All imported photos, videos, and generated outputs remain on the device until deleted by the user.

### Backend Processing
Media sent to the backend:

- Is processed in memory  
- Is **never stored**  
- Is discarded immediately after processing

### No Cloud Storage
We do not use any cloud storage services for user content.

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Vivere uses the following external services **only for temporary processing**:

### **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text (ASR)**  
Used to convert spoken audio into text for the AI Companion.  
- Audio is transmitted securely  
- Google does **not** store the audio or use it for model training  
- Processing is temporary only

### **Gemini**  
Processes text to generate responses for the AI Companion.

### **Veo**  
Generates AI-based video outputs.

Our backend acts only as a **transient bridge** and does not store any data.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The app is intended for caregivers and older adults.  
We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

---

## 7. Security Measures

We implement reasonable security protections, including:

- Encrypted HTTPS connections  
- No persistence of data in backend systems  
- Sandboxed local storage provided by iPadOS  

While no system can guarantee absolute security, we take all appropriate measures.

---

## 8. User Controls

Users may:

- Delete photos and videos from the app  
- Delete all local app data by uninstalling the app  
- Revoke permissions through iPadOS settings  
- Manage diagnostic sharing through Apple system settings  

The app does not use accounts, so no additional data deletion requests are required.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as the app evolves.  
Changes will be reflected in this document.
